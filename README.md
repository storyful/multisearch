## Storyful MultiSearch

A Google Chrome browser extension to help you search multiple social networks quickly and
efficiently.

## Note

The Storyful maintained version of this extension in the Google Store records usage via Google Analytics
and Mixpanel. We only record that the extension was opened and when a search is requested, not the search 
term or which search services were selected.

or the unpacked version into your local Chrome browser using the Extensions page;
